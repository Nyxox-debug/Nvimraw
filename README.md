# Nvimraw

A minimal Neovim config I use as a personal setup.  
Itâ€™s built with **[lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)** for plugin management, but kept simple and lightweight.  

## Features
- Minimal setup, easy to extend
- Bootstrapped with **lazy.nvim**
- Clean structure for fast startup
- Focused on editing, not bloat

## Installation
Clone this repo into your Neovim config directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nyxox-debug/nvimraw ~/.config/nvim
